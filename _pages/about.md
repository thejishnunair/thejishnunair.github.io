I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/), working on reasoning in large language models and reinforcement learning for agentic systems. Most of my time goes into figuring out how to make LLMs better at complex decision-making and how multiple agents can work together on real-world enterprise problems.

Broadly, I'm interested in **LLM reasoning**, **reinforcement learning**, **synthetic data generation**, **evaluation methods for generative AI**, and **agentic systems**.

Before this, I spent a few years building semantic search, enterprise-level clustering services, and NLP infrastructure at ServiceNow.

I did my undergrad in Computer Science at [Government Model Engineering College, Kochi](https://mec.ac.in/).
